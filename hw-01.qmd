## 2 - NYC marathon winners

```{r label-me-2}
# Generate dataset without NA values for time
nyc_clean <- nyc_marathon[-which(is.na(nyc_marathon$time)),]

# summary of data
summary(nyc_clean)

## Part A
# Histogram
nyc_hist <- ggplot(nyc_clean, aes(time)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  ggtitle("Histogram Of Marathon Times")

# Boxplot
nyc_box <- ggplot(nyc_clean, aes(time)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Boxplot Of Marathon Times") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

# Plot both plots
list(nyc_hist, nyc_box)

# The histogram more readily shows that the marathon times are bimodal. The
# boxplot more readily shows several statistics of the marathon times: minimum,
# 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, maximum, and outliers.

## Part B
# Boxplot
ggplot(nyc_clean, aes(y = time, x = division, fill = division)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Boxplot Of Marathon Times Between Divisions") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))  +
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())

# From the side-by-side boxplot, it is clear that the men's division has
# has faster marathon times compared to the women's division with the exception
# of a few outliers.

## Part C
# The boxplot from part B has the division and its colors listed twice. This
# information is listed in both  the x-axis of the graph and in the legends.

# Boxplot with legends removed
ggplot(nyc_clean, aes(y = time, x = division, fill = division)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot Of Marathon Times Between Divisions") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())

## Part D
# Plot the marathon times over the years with distinction of divisions
ggplot(nyc_clean, aes(x = year, y = time, color = division, shape = division)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
  ggtitle("Marathon Times Of Men And Women Over The Years")
  # geom_line(data = nyc_clean[which(nyc_clean$division == "Men"),],
  #           aes(y = time, x = year), color = "blue") +
  # geom_line(data = nyc_clean[-which(nyc_clean$division == "Men"),],
  #           aes(y = time, x = year), color = "red") +

# The plot of marathon times across the years between division uniquely
# indicates that the marathon times have roughly stabilized since 1977.
# Additionally, the time gap between divisions seemed to be consistent.
